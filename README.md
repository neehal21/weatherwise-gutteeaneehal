## 🚀 How to Use This App

To run the WeatherWise app:

1. **Open the Notebook**
   Launch `starter_notebook.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

2. **Explore the Sections**
   The notebook is organised into modular sections:

   * `weather_data.py`: Fetches weather from wttr.in using a clean and reliable API call.
   * `visualisation.py`: Displays graphs for temperature trends, precipitation chances, etc.
   * `interface.py`: Includes a simple natural language interface powered by Python functions.

3. **Run the Code**

   * First, execute the code cells from top to bottom to load all modules.
   * When prompted, enter a location (e.g., "Melbourne") and number of forecast days (e.g., 3).
   * The app will fetch and display current weather data and forecast visualisations.
   * You can also interact with the conversational assistant at the bottom of the notebook.

4. **Using the App's Features**

   * **Weather Retrieval**: Enter any city name to see its forecast.
   * **Visualisations**: View easy-to-understand graphs about upcoming weather trends.
   * **AI Interaction**: Use natural prompts like “Will it rain in Brisbane tomorrow?” to get smart answers.
