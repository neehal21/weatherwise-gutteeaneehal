# ‚úçÔ∏è Project Reflection

## ü§ñ AI Tools Used

I used ChatGPT throughout the development process. It supported me in structuring modular Python code, debugging functions, improving data visualisation techniques using `matplotlib`, and generating natural language interfaces. I also used it to refine my GitHub documentation and write intentional AI prompting examples.
The AI acted as a thinking partner, helping me move past roadblocks, validate ideas, and iterate faster.

## üí¨ Prompting Techniques

I applied several **intentional prompting strategies**:

* **Socratic prompting** to understand why certain approaches were chosen (e.g., "Why use list comprehension here?").
* **Comparative prompting** to explore different ways to implement visualisations (e.g., "Bar chart vs. line chart for temperature trends").
* **Refinement prompting** to optimise and clean up initial code (e.g., "Make this function more Pythonic and readable").
* **Failure-driven prompting** to test and improve the app's response to edge cases (e.g., "How will this function handle missing data?").
* **Meta-prompting** to improve the way I asked technical questions (e.g., "How should I prompt you to debug this function properly?").

## ‚úÖ What Worked Well?

I'm proud of how the modular structure came together. Each component (weather retrieval, visualisation, and natural language interface) was isolated and reusable. Using AI as a collaborative coding partner made it possible to move from vague ideas to working code much faster than if I were working alone.

## üîÑ What Would You Do Differently?

If I had more time, I would focus on strengthening the error management system throughout all components, particularly for input validation and API response failures. Additionally, I would dedicate more effort to enhancing the visual aesthetics and accessibility features of the data visualizations to create a better user experience.
## üéì Final Thoughts

This project taught me that AI isn‚Äôt just a tool for generating code ‚Äî it‚Äôs a learning companion. By prompting with intention, I was able to improve not only the quality of my project but also my understanding of Python and software development best practices. I now view AI as part of my development workflow, not just a last resort.
