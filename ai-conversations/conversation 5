Me: My visualisation is showing empty plots. What could be wrong?
AI: First, check if your data lists (e.g. x and y) are populated. Try printing them before plotting.

Me: Ah, my temperature list was empty.
AI: That means the API response may be missing data or your parsing failed. Add logging to confirm.

Me: How do I add logging?
AI: Use Pythonâ€™s built-in logging module:

python

import logging  
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)  
logging.info("Temp data: %s", temps)
yaml
