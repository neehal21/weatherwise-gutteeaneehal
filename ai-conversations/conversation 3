Me: I want to parse a natural language question like "What will the temperature be in Sydney tomorrow?" How do I extract location and time?
AI: You can use regex or NLP libraries like spaCy. A simple approach is keyword matching.

Me: Can you sketch a basic function for this?
AI: Sure, hereâ€™s a simple example:


def parse_weather_question(question):
    locations = ["Sydney", "Melbourne", "Brisbane"]
    for loc in locations:
        if loc.lower() in question.lower():
            location = loc
            break
    if "tomorrow" in question.lower():
        day = 1
    else:
        day = 0
    return {"location": location, "day_offset": day}
