Me: How can I structure my WeatherWise app into modules?  
AI: Break it into functional files:  
- `weather_fetcher.py` for API calls  
- `data_parser.py` for JSON handling  
- `visualiser.py` for charts  
- `main.py` to integrate everything

Me: Should I pass data between modules as raw JSON?  
AI: Better to parse what you need first, then pass structured data like dictionaries or lists.

Me: Got it. Any naming tips?  
AI: Keep functions descriptive. For example:  
- `fetch_weather_data()`  
- `extract_temperature_series()`  
- `plot_temperature_trend()`
