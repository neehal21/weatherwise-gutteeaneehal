Me: How do I retrieve weather data for a given location in Python?
AI: You can use the `fetch-my-weather` package with `get_weather(location)` to get current weather and forecasts.

Me: Can you show me a function that takes location and days as input and returns the weather data?
AI: Sure! Hereâ€™s a simple function:

```python
from fetch_my_weather import get_weather

def get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5):
    weather = get_weather(location)
    return weather["forecast"][:forecast_days]
